    <p>Rabindro Nath Tagor says:</p>
    <blockquote>
       <q>I slept and dreamt that life was joy. ...
        You can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water. ...
        Faith is the bird that feels the light when the dawn is still dark. ...
        Clouds come floating into my life, no longer to carry rain or usher storm, but to add color to my sunset sky.</q>
